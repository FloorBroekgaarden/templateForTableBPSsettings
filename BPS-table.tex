% Change log
%
% v3.0 May 2015
%    Renamed to match the new package name
%    Version number matches mnras.cls
%    A few minor tweaks to wording
% v1.0 September 2013
%    Beta testing only - never publicly released
%    First version: a simple (ish) template for creating an MNRAS paper

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Basic setup. Most papers should leave these options alone.
\documentclass[fleqn,usenatbib, onecolumn]{mnras}

% MNRAS is set in Times font. If you don't have this installed (most LaTeX
% installations will be fine) or prefer the old Computer Modern fonts, comment
% out the following line
\usepackage{newtxtext,newtxmath}
% Depending on your LaTeX fonts installation, you might get better results with one of these:
%\usepackage{mathptmx}
%\usepackage{txfonts}

% Use vector fonts, so it zooms properly in on-screen viewing software
% Don't change these lines unless you know what you are doing
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

% Allow "Thomas van Noord" and "Simon de Laguarde" and alike to be sorted by "N" and "L" etc. in the bibliography.

% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
This document shares a template for describing your fiducial settings of your binary population synthesis model. Feel free to use / share! This table was inspired by \citep{2018MNRAS.481.1908K} and is currently based on the table as presented in Broekgaarden et al., (subm). Feel free to use it in any way you want and/or use an edited version for your own paper. No credits needed; I am merely sharing this in case it can help other (binary) population synthesis papers to provide a clear and easy summary of their model settings and assumptions. The main template uses the binary population synthesis code COMPAS. Please  feel free to add  templates for other codes, or e.g., add the table that you ended up using. You can add this as a new section and include a reference to the paper in which it has been used. 
The code for this document is in overleaf \href{https://www.overleaf.com/7756463156hthtyzgzdkhn}{https://www.overleaf.com/7756463156hthtyzgzdkhn} and github  \href{https://github.com/FloorBroekgaarden/templateForTableBPSsettings}{https://github.com/FloorBroekgaarden/templateForTableBPSsettings}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\section{Introduction}
The table uses a couple of defined symbols and constants, such as for the solar mass. These can be found just before the title page. It currently makes use of the package `xspace'. 






\section{COMPAS}
Table~\ref{tab:COMPAS} shows an example of a table summarizing the binary population synthesis settings for a simulation using the code {\sc{COMPAS}}. This table is used in Broekgaarden et al., (subm.). You can easily remove the cyan stars in front of some of the rows.
